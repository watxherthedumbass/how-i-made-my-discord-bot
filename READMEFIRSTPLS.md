Press add bot,after adding a bot you can change it's pfp and the name of your bot after doing all of that click "0Auth2" on the setting category and then click "URL generator" after clicking you will find something called scopes,
Click on the square of the scopes named "bot" and "application.commands" after clicking it,scroll down and you'll see "bot permissions" click administrator and then scroll down again after scrolling down copy the generated URL and paste it into your browser and add your bot to a server or a guild,
After adding your bot now its time to code it if you notice it your bot is offline which means you still havent coded it yet,so the steps on how to code it is..
go to replit.com,make an account,click the plus sign to make a new replit project,find the coding language named "python"if you found it click it,after clicking press create replt,then you can now read and copy paste the code inside code.py
